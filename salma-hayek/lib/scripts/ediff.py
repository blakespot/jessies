# A "diff" utility that also includes information about changes within lines.

# Each line begins with a single-character code, similar to "diff -u" output:
#   "-"  line unique to file1.
#   "+"  line unique to file2.
#   " "  line common to both files.
#   "?"  non-whitespace characters on this line mark the changed characters on
#        the previous line (which will have been a "-" or "+" line).

# The exit status is POSIX compliant:
#   0  no differences were found.
#   1  differences were found.
#  >1  an error occurred.

# More on POSIX diff(1) (but note that POSIX doesn't include -u):
