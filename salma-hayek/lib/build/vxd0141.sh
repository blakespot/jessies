# cron-config
# Install as service, run as yourself (otherwise today exim crashes into /var/log/cron.log), don't set CYGWIN.
# This requires your Windows password, which, despite the prompts, it seems you can't really update with passwd -R.
# That seems to succeed but doesn't help cron to start.
# Rerun cron-config instead.

# Install as service, run under the LocalSystem account, don't set CYGWIN.
# It asks whether the primary hostname is all in lower case.
# You say "yes", it says that Exim will auto-discover that.
# It won't.
# You need a line in /etc/exim.conf saying:
# primary hostname = vxd0141.corp.hds.com
# In /etc/exim.conf:
# the rewrite section is empty by default

# Using Samba is hard and insanely slow from Cygwin.
# I realized that I really didn't want the Windows machine connecting over Samba and doing make clean while
# the Debian build was happening.
# So I cloned local salma-hayek and terminator repositories.
# Then I couldn't build them because "Documents and Settings" contains a space and it's basically a big waste of time
# to try to get make(1) to cope with file names containing spaces.
# It can be done but it's not worth the effort.
# Mounting C:\Documents and Settings\martind on /home/martind, however, works fine.

# When switching to a different major version of Cygwin:
# cygrunsrv --stop exim; cygrunsrv --stop cron; cygrunsrv --stop cygserver
# cygrunsrv --remove cygserver
# cygserver-config
# cygrunsrv --start exim
# cygrunsrv --start cron

# You really want the --no flags, as the documentation is enormous.
# And, oh teh irony, who's going to do anything other than Google for answers anyway?
# We'll want:
# http://www.rubydoc.info/github/google/google-api-ruby-client/file/MIGRATING.md
# ... once we can abandon Ruby 1.9 - pfuff!
# We haven't even quite managed to abandon Debian Squeeze.
# That defaults to Ruby 1.8, though we do make it use Ruby 1.9.
# gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --version "< 0.9" google-api-client

# See the note in salma-hayek/lib/build/drive.rb about "invalid_grant".
