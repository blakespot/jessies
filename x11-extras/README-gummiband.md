# Gummiband

Gummiband is a program launcher for the X Window System.
It can be configured to show machine status (eg battery %, or the time),
and to provide launch buttons (eg a button to run xterm).
It provides simple drop-down menus (eg a button can show the current wifi
access point, and clicking on the button opens a menu allowing a different
access point to be selected).

Gummiband is based loosely on the 'menu' program by Elliott Hughes.
