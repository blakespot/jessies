# Terminator, Evergreen, lwm and friends

Terminator is a cross-platform GPL terminal emulator with advanced features not yet found elsewhere.

Evergreen is a cross-platform GPL development environment that tries to be lightweight and language-agnostic yet functional.

lwm, the Lightweight Window Manager for the X Window System, provides enough features to allow the user to manage their windows, and no more.
